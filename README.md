# **Cbot**

The primary purpose of this project is to create a platform that would give users the ability to create crypto-trading
strategies which could then be executed by a crypto trading bot. Users would have access to an online dashboard 
to create strategies, activate the bot, and monitor the resulting trades.

The secondary purpose is to provide experience in a variety of software developer languages, techniques,
tools, and frameworks. The project has three components; frontend, backend, and test harness.
